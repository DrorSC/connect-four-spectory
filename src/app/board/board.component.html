<ul>ideas:
  <li>replace "here" with empty arrows.png and fill them with player's color for each Turn</li>
  <li>add a pre-game preferences so the maker can decided how many rows/colums & cells to connect</li>
  <li>when a player wins -> show the sequence that won him the game</li>
  <li>show each player's turn in a nicer way. with color indication</li>
</ul>
